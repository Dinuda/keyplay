# keyplay
reconstructed video based on keyframe embeddings and interpolations

## Performance so far

    Original size: 1.50 MB
    Compressed size: 0.76 MB
    Compression ratio: 1.96x

### New compression technique

1. Sparse voxel encoding
- use vector embeddings to encode keyframes
- store high details
- compress static regions heavily

P.S. This is a work in progress. (Will resume after 28th Nov.)
